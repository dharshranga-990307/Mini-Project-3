# Mini-Project-3
CarDekho-Used Car Price Prediction

The main objective of the project is to predict the price of the used car based on the features provided.

Skills Learned -Analyzing the data,Building a ml model and streamlit application.

Process - Filling the null values
                Change the datatype if needed.
                Exploratory Data Analysis
                Remove the outliers
                Select the feature needed
                Encode the features
                Build the Machine Learning Model
                Evaluation metrics
                Cross Validation
                Hyperparameter Tuning 
                Use the model for Predicting price
Results - The price is predicted using the features like city, Mileage,Ownership,Transmission,Insurance Type,Vehicle Age and Engine Displacement. This project has given a clear understanding of Ml concepts and the knowledge about when to use the techniques.
